This software exists to replace a personal media manager https://github.com/pounard/wps/ based upon the Symfony 2 full stack framework. Its primary goal is to slowly replace the external web services I use, and later in the future maybe also replace some modules of Owncloud I use.

Current application status is that the personnal photo and video gallery works very nicely for display and sharing, but still lacks features.
